        <h2 class="mb-4">Exercise 6: Process Management</h2>
<p>
			Process management is a useful skill to master when learning Linux. It allows you to pry into the roots of what your system is doing thread by thread. A process in Linux is just what they call any program that is being executed. There are two types of processes Foreground and Background processes. Foreground processes are initiated by the user while Background processes are initiated by the system. Let’s test a Foreground process by typing:

</p>			
<p><code>sleep 10</code></p>
<p>You may have noticed that after running that command your console became inactive. That’s exactly what the sleep command does, it pauses the execution of the next shell command. Linux lets us see all processes that are currently running by typing:</p>

<p><code>top
</code></p>

<p>This command displays a list of currently running processes along with their CPU and memory usage. The table at first glance can feel very overwhelming and takes time to adjust to. To help you better understand what is going on we have provided you with the list of all the table headings definitions below.</p>
<p>
	<code>PID:</code> Unique Process ID given to each process.<br>
<code>PPID:</code> stands for "parent process ID", which is the process that created the process<br> 
<code>STAT:</code> State in which the process is in.<br>&emsp;
   <code> D </code>   Uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)<br>&emsp;
	<code>R </code>   Running or runnable (on run queue)<br>&emsp;
	<code>S</code>    Interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)<br>&emsp;
	<code>T </code>   Stopped, by a job control signal or because it is being traced.<br>&emsp;
	<code>X</code>    dead (should never be seen)<br>&emsp;
	<code>Z</code>    Defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped<br>

Additional but not required:<br>&emsp;
	<code><span>&#60;</span> </code>    high-priority <br>&emsp;
	<code>N </code>   low-priority <br>&emsp;
	<code>L</code>    has pages locked into memory <br>&emsp;
	<code>s </code>   is a session leader<br>&emsp;
	<code>l</code>    is multi-threaded <br>&emsp;
	<code>+</code>    is in the foreground process group  <br>   
<code>User:</code> Username of the process owner.<br>  
<code>VSZ: </code>is short for Virtual Memory Size. It's the total amount of memory a process may hypothetically access.<br>  
<code>%VSZ: </code>Percentage of Virtual Memory Size used by the process.<br>  
<code>%CPU:</code> Percentage of CPU used by the process.<br>  
<code>Command:</code> Command used to activate the process.<br>  
</p>
<p>Now that we have seen all threads running let’s exit the list by typing q. Now let's say what happens if you want to kill a process. To do this all we need is the <code>PID </code>of the process and the command <code>kill [PID]</code>. Try it out for yourself, but do not wait for a response as<code> kill</code> does not have a response. Processes offer us tons of information but it takes some time to get used to so do not worry if you feel overwhelmed now.’
